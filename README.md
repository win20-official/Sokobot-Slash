# Sokobot-Slash

## Features
### Infinite levels
The maps in Sokobot-Slash are randomly generated, increasing in difficulty as you progress.
### Varied controls
Sokobot-Slash has multiple control options to improve the player's experience, including reactions and wasd commands!
### Simultaneous games
Thanks to the power of Java HashMaps™️, multiple users can use the bot at the same time without interfering with one another.
### Custom prefixes ``New!``
To prevent Sokobot from conflicting with other bots, admins can choose any single-character prefix to preface Sokobot's commands.

## Commands
### User
- ``!play`` and ``/play`` can be used to start a game if you are not currently in one.
- ``!stop`` and ``/stop`` can be used to stop your active game at any time.
- ``!info`` and ``/info`` provides some useful details about the bot and rules of the game.
### Admin ``New!``
- ~~``!prefix [character]`` can be used to change the prefix the bot responds to in the current server. 

## Usage
### Public host ``New!``
Sokobot is available on top.gg and can be added to your server [in one click](https://top.gg/bot/713635251703906336/)! 
### Self-hosting
Grab the [latest .jar](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Sokobot/releases) or [build it yourself](#compiling). Then, create a Discord Bot Application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and paste the bot token into ``token.txt``. Then, ensure the two files are in the same directory and run the .jar file.
Please note, this bot differs a bit from the public bot. For example, there is no voting rewards (custom emotes are always unlocked), no leaderboard, no progress saving, etc.



## Compiling

Install [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
In the root folder of the project, execute ``gradlew shadowJar``.
The compiled .jar file will be located in ``build/libs``.
